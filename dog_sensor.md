# üêæ Why Dogs? (Instinct as Sensor)

Canine companionship is ancient. Long before humans wrote scripts or measured wavelengths,
we watched our dogs for cues. Their senses catch shifts in the environment that our modern
instruments sometimes gloss over. A dog's pause, a tilt of the head, or a sudden reluctance
to advance is never random; it is rooted in thousands of years of evolution. For hunters and
travelers, such moments often meant the difference between safety and peril.

In this project we turn those instinctive hesitations into data points. Each pause is logged
with GPS coordinates and compared against NDVI satellite imagery. When a dog's hesitation aligns
with a vegetation anomaly or an indigenous place name hinting at old habitations, our confidence
grows. The dog's behavior functions as a soft signal‚Äîa whisper rather than a shout‚Äîthat
complements hard metrics like spectral signatures.

Why might dogs sense what satellites do not? Canine perception weaves together smell, subtle
vibrations, and memory. Even well-fed domestic dogs retain fragments of their ancestors'
survival instincts. They notice faint shifts in soil composition or humidity that betray old
disturbances. Such signals do not always register in remote sensing. Yet dogs register them
effortlessly, responding with visible caution or curiosity.

We do not romanticize this process; no mysticism is required. Instead, we recognize that
evolution wired dogs to interpret complex patterns in scent and sound far better than we do. By
documenting hesitation points, we effectively borrow their sensory map. These data, layered
atop NDVI clusters and GPT-analyzed toponyms, reveal patterns that might otherwise stay hidden.

This approach is not meant to replace rigorous archaeological survey. Rather, it sharpens the
search, allowing field teams to prioritize zones where multiple indicators converge. A dog's
reluctance alone proves nothing, but in combination with spectral anomalies and toponymic
references, it strengthens the case for further investigation. In several test walks, clusters
of hesitations corresponded with soil irregularities and low mounds only visible once on site.

Our methodology remains lightweight and open-ended. Anyone with a GPS-enabled device can record
their dog's movements. By pooling these traces across communities, we build a distributed sensor
network rooted in trust between humans and animals. The data may be fuzzy, but it is uniquely
sensitive to environmental echoes left by past cultures.

In the Amazon, where thick foliage obscures centuries of history, tapping into instinctive
awareness is not superstition‚Äîit is pragmatism. Dogs bring a form of pre-cognitive sensing
that extends our own perception. Just as NDVI exposes patterns in greenery and GPT models parse
linguistic hints, canine behavior offers a grounded reminder that the land speaks through many
channels. Listening to our oldest companions may help us recover what time tried to erase.
