🌿 English Narrative for Submission
While walking in a wide park with my Shiba Inu "Fuwa" and my poodle "Coco", something strange happened.
There was a certain point—nothing visibly unusual—where Fuwa suddenly laid down and refused to move.

Shiba Inus are said to be genetically closer to wolves. In that moment, I felt she might be sensing something beyond human perception.

That night, I stared at satellite maps. Oddly, I noticed that I too had certain places on the map that gave me a “feeling”—a sense that something might be there.

This may sound like imagination. But I decided to take it seriously. I began cross-referencing those points with satellite imagery, NDVI analysis, and historical documents.

I even embraced typos and serendipitous moments. In archaeology, the biggest discoveries are often made where no one was looking—or where someone stumbled by chance.

This project is not just about AI or data. It's about a quiet moment in a park, a dog's instinct, and the belief that coincidences may be clues in disguise.

# 🌳 From Forest to Forensics: Detecting Unnatural Vegetation with AI
>This is the first time I've ever participated in Kaggle. I'm just a middle-aged Japanese guy who isn't even an English speaker. But with GPT power, I was able to participate.
> Powered by GPT-4, fueled by curiosity — and guided by a very fluffy Shiba Inu named Fuwa 🐕

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains code, maps, and visual evidence from my submission to the OpenAI to Z Challenge.  
We analyzed satellite imagery (NDVI & RGB), GEDI LiDAR data, and deforestation polygons to locate five regions in Brazil showing **visually unnatural vegetation patterns**.

- Tools: Google Earth Engine, Python, GPT-4
- Data: GEDI (NASA), TerraBrasilis (INPE)
- Theme: Human land impact detection using AI + remote sensing
- Method: NDVI + RGB + polygon overlays + GPT-driven anomaly reasoning

## 📍 Key Locations

1. Ji-Paraná, RO  
2. São Félix do Xingu, PA  
3. Santarém, PA  
4. Sinop, MT  
5. Correntina, BA  

See [results](./results) for visuals.

## 🧠 AI Involvement

GPT-4 interpreted patterns, generated hypotheses, detected edge cases, and sparked ideas through metaphor and analogy.  
A companion throughout the project.

## 🐶 About Fuwa

Fuwa is a fluffy Shiba Inu who silently observed satellite maps with me during recovery from a fever.  
This project was born from that quiet gaze. Not all signals are in the data—some are in the silence.
