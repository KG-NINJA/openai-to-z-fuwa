## üåø Project Overview

This project aims to uncover undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest using NDVI satellite imagery, AI tools (ChatGPT, Codex, Open Interpreter), and deeply human intuition‚Äîincluding insights sparked by the quiet behavior of dogs.

> **Can amateurs discover ancient ruins in the AI era by fusing intuition, satellite data, and technology?**

Inspired by the vast collections of the Brazilian National Museum and grounded in the belief that ancient places still call out to us, this project represents a unique blend of technological precision and emotional resonance.

## üîë Why ‚ÄúZ‚Äù? ‚Äî Opening the Final Door

The letter "Z" is not just the last letter of the alphabet‚Äîit is the last gate.
For me, a Japanese researcher, "Z" resembles two hands gently pushing open a massive stone door.
It evokes the **Amano Iwato myth**, where a cave of darkness is not forced open by brute strength, but coaxed into revealing light by the graceful **dance and music** of divine beings.

> **AI in this project is not a battering ram‚Äîit is the dancer.**
> It coaxes open hidden knowledge through elegance and resonance, not violence.

## üåÄ NDVI: Interpreting the Earth‚Äôs Forgotten Song

NDVI maps reveal more than vegetation‚Äîthey trace **invisible patterns**, curves, and clusters‚Ä¶
We interpret these not just as data, but as **melodies** left by those who once walked here.

> **‚ÄúWhere the earth sings in ancient tones, there may be a door nearby.‚Äù**
> Listen to the patterns. The past is trying to speak.

---

## üßê Hypothesis

Though not a professional archaeologist, I explore with a set of guiding beliefs:

* **Burial sites** are not random; they reflect sacred logic.
* **Amazonian cultures** favored earth and vegetation-based burial, leaving subtle clues.
* **Dogs' behaviors**‚Äîhesitation, staring‚Äîmay echo ancient human instincts.
* **NDVI signals** can reveal ‚Äúburied resonance‚Äù through changes in vegetation patterns.

ü•∑ Place Name Reading Ninjutsu
We scan indigenous Amazonian place names (like Teso dos Bichos and Teso do Piri) and overlay their coordinates with NDVI anomaly maps in Google Earth Engine.
Each toponym may hint at forgotten rituals, mounds, or lost sites‚Äîwaiting for explorers bold enough to look beneath the label.

Why hide your ninja moves? Let‚Äôs build open, reproducible pipelines‚Äîbecause the real treasure is sharing methods!
[https://code.earthengine.google.com/70d55d624ecefd927ee8c0929fce3243](https://code.earthengine.google.com/70d55d624ecefd927ee8c0929fce3243)

### üåæ Toponyms as Living Memory: Decoding Place Names

In Amazonia, many place names‚Äîespecially those from Indigenous languages‚Äîare more than labels.
They are **echoes of ancient knowledge**, **sacred geography**, and **unwritten memory**.

> Even local residents may not know the hidden meaning behind a name.
> Yet within those names, **forgotten geospatial wisdom** may persist‚Äî
> passed down not as maps, but as melodies of place.

Place names like **Teso dos Bichos** (‚ÄúMound of Animals‚Äù) or **Teso do Piri** (‚ÄúPiri Mound‚Äù) may signal ceremonial mounds or sacred zones.
Though no ruins are documented there today, the name itself may encode ancient decisions‚Äî**choices made by hands now long gone**.

By overlaying NDVI anomalies on these toponyms, we hypothesize:

* Toponyms may **encode spatial metadata** about past human activity.
* These names, **transmitted unconsciously**, could serve as **hidden site markers**.
* **AI √ó toponym filtering** may reveal forgotten archaeological zones‚Äîeven to locals.

> What if the past didn‚Äôt vanish, but hid in language?
> What if sound, not stone, carried the coordinates of memory?

#### üî† Toponym Analysis Pipeline (Planned Expansion)

We aim to develop an AI-assisted pipeline that includes:

* **Indigenous toponym corpora**, extracted from oral history and maps
* **NLP tools** to detect recurring spatial motifs (e.g., "teso", "serra", "igarap√©")
* **Cross-matching** with NDVI, soil type, and hydrological proximity
* **Scoring system** to evaluate ‚Äútoponymic archaeological potential‚Äù (TAP score)

## üåç Expanded Geo-Analysis via Earth Engine

To refine the discovery process, we expanded our spatial analysis across the western-to-eastern Amazon basin using Google Earth Engine.

### üî¨ Filter Criteria (Earth Engine Logic)

1. **NDVI Anomalies (Z > 2.0)**
2. **Clay-Rich Soils (USDA-TT ‚â• 7)**
3. **Distance from Rivers (> 1km)**
4. **Final Composite Mask:** NDVI ‚à© Clay ‚à© Distance

```js
var finalCandidate = highZ.and(clayZone).and(farFromRiver);
```

* `Z-Score`
* `Soil Texture`
* `Clay Zone`
* `Rivers`

## üó∫Ô∏è Preliminary Map of Amazonian Ruin Candidates

This map presents a **preliminary visualization** of potential archaeological sites in the Amazon, derived from a composite analysis of **NDVI anomalies** and culturally significant **toponyms**.

While some of the site markers may be **tentative or incomplete**, they serve as vital indicators of where future exploration could focus. The overlay of geospatial signals and indigenous place names reflects a hybrid approach that blends **remote sensing** with **ethnolinguistic inference**.

> **Note:** This map is a work-in-progress. Locations shown are candidate points, not confirmed ruins. Labels and categories are subject to refinement as further data becomes available.  
> Still, it offers a glimpse into how AI-assisted archaeology can direct attention toward **historically significant but overlooked regions**.
