# OpenAI to Z: AI-Driven Exploration of Hidden Amazonian Ruins

## 🌿 Project Overview

This project aims to uncover undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest by combining advanced satellite imagery analysis (primarily NDVI), AI technologies (ChatGPT, Codex, Open Interpreter), and human intuition—including observations inspired by my dogs' behavior. It seeks to answer an ambitious question: **Can amateurs make significant archaeological discoveries in the AI era by leveraging intuition, technology, and scientific methods?**

## 🎯 Purpose & Inspiration

As someone without formal archaeological training but deeply intrigued by historical sites, I aim to apply personal insights gathered from observing local ruins to unexplored regions of the Amazon. My hypothesis is rooted in universal human behavior: people typically do not establish burial sites directly within their living spaces but also do not place them far away from settlements.

Considering the indigenous Amazonian tradition of earth burial, the location of burial grounds should correlate closely with soil composition suitable for burial. Identifying potential burial grounds through satellite analysis can therefore lead us to previously unknown living or ceremonial sites.

Interestingly, my dogs, Fuwa (a Shiba Inu) and Coco (a Poodle), often stop and behave noticeably differently at specific points during our walks—places that seem to emanate either comfort or discomfort. Ancient people, known for their heightened intuitive senses, may have experienced similar feelings, making contemporary observations of intuitive behavior potentially valuable for archaeological insights.

The ultimate goal is to validate this approach through tangible discoveries, and to share the methodologies and findings openly via the Kaggle "OpenAI to Z" Challenge, creating a reproducible template for AI-driven archaeology.

## 🛠 Technology & Tools

* **Satellite Data Processing:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
* **AI Integration:** ChatGPT, Codex, Open Interpreter
* **Automation:** Markdown report generation, automated code workflows
* **Collaboration & Documentation:** GitHub with MCP integration readiness

## 📀 Workflow & Implementation

1. **NDVI Anomaly Detection:** Satellite imagery analyzed to highlight unusual vegetation patterns.
2. **Cross-Referencing:** Combining GeoJSON geographic data, historic explorer records, and satellite imagery analytics.
3. **Intuitive Insights:** Incorporating insights from pet behavior (Fuwa and Coco) as inspirational cues.
4. **Automated Reporting:** Consistent Markdown-based documentation generated by `report_generator.py` and structured using `template.md`.
5. **Visualization & Narrative:** Integrating data visualizations with poetic and scientific descriptions.
6. **Z Log:** Progress and discovery logs regularly shared on Kaggle and GitHub.

## ✨ Unique Features

* **Intuition Meets AI:** Emphasizing deep insights achievable only through the fusion of human intuition and AI.
* **Animal-Inspired Analysis:** Enhancing scientific rigor with unique, intuitive perspectives gained from pet behavior.
* **Reproducibility & Automation:** All methods are structured into clear, automated templates for easy replication and validation.
* **Mythological Symbolism:** Utilizing the metaphor of "Amano Iwato" (opening a mythical stone gate) to symbolize unlocking hidden knowledge through AI.
* **Future-Proof AI Workflow:** Early adoption and implementation of GitHub MCP and next-generation AI collaboration frameworks.

## 🚀 Future Vision

This repository aims not only to pioneer new methods in AI-assisted archaeology but also to serve as a foundational model for future interdisciplinary explorations combining intuitive human experiences with advanced technological tools.

# 🗂 Codex-Powered File Organizer for Kaggle Projects

> “Let Codex clean your desk, so your mind can explore the jungle.”
> — KG\_NINJA

## 🔍 Overview

Managing a multi-modal Kaggle project like **OpenAI to Z** means handling messy directories:

* 🚁 Satellite images (NDVI, RGB)
* 📊 Analytical results (GeoTIFF, CSV, PNG)
* 🧠 AI-generated reports (Markdown, PDF)
* 🧪 Code & scripts (Python, CLI)

To maintain clarity, I used **OpenAI Codex** to create an intelligent file organizer that:

* 📦 Sorts by semantic file type
* 📝 Renames files with readable conventions
* 📂 Moves them into logical subfolders
* 🧠 Requires no manual drag-and-drop

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

| Requirement           | Description                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Codex access       | ChatGPT Pro, Copilot Workspace, or API |
| 🐍 Python ≥ 3.10      | Local runtime for execution            |
| 📁 `/results/` folder | Where raw outputs are dumped           |

Example starting structure:

```
results/
├── o3_ndvi_zscore.png
├── o3_ndvi_candidates.geojson
├── obidos_zscore_stats.csv
├── ndvi_stack_raw.tif
├── report.md
```

## ✨ Codex Prompt

```python
"""
Organize files in /results/ folder.
Rules:
- *.png → visuals/
- *.geojson → maps/
- *.csv → metrics/
- *.md → reports/
- *.tif → raw_data/
Also, rename any file starting with 'o3_' → 'ObidosSouth_'
"""
import os, shutil

file_map = {
    '.png': 'visuals',
    '.geojson': 'maps',
    '.csv': 'metrics',
    '.md': 'reports',
    '.tif': 'raw_data'
}

root = 'results'
for fname in os.listdir(root):
    ext = os.path.splitext(fname)[1]
    if ext in file_map:
        new_dir = os.path.join(root, file_map[ext])
        os.makedirs(new_dir, exist_ok=True)
        new_name = fname.replace('o3_', 'ObidosSouth_')
        shutil.move(os.path.join(root, fname), os.path.join(new_dir, new_name))
```

## ✅ Output Structure

After running the Codex-generated script:

```
results/
├── visuals/
│   └── ObidosSouth_ndvi_zscore.png
├── maps/
│   └── ObidosSouth_ndvi_candidates.geojson
├── metrics/
│   └── ObidosSouth_zscore_stats.csv
├── reports/
│   └── ObidosSouth_report.md
├── raw_data/
│   └── ObidosSouth_ndvi_stack_raw.tif
```

## 🧪 Bonus Codex Tasks

You can prompt Codex to do even more:

* "Summarize all CSVs into one table."
* "Generate README.md describing each result."
* "Find orphaned files not referenced in reports."

Let Codex automate the boring parts — so you can focus on uncovering lost cities. 🏛

## 🧠 Why Use Codex?

| Benefit       | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🔍 Clarity    | Know exactly where every file lives        |
| 📜 Structure  | Supports reproducibility and clean commits |
| ⛩ Harmony     | Intuition + automation = creative flow     |
| 🛠 Automation | Avoid grunt work, think big                |
