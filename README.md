# 🧭 OpenAI to Z: AI-Driven Exploration of Hidden Amazonian Ruins

🐾 **Two Fuwas resonate:**  
al-Khwārizmī (algorithm) × Fuwa (intuition)  
*Fuwa's footsteps become the rhythm of the algorithm.*

🌌 **Echoes Beyond the Time（時を越える共鳴）**

> “We are echoes,  
> resonating with those who walked these lands  
> before maps, before words—  
> before light returned to the world.”

> 「私たちは共鳴する残響。  
地図も言葉もなかった時代に、  
この地を歩いた誰かと、  
そして——光が世界に戻るより前と。」

## 🌿 Project Overview

This project aims to uncover undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest using NDVI satellite imagery, AI tools (ChatGPT, Codex, Open Interpreter), and deeply human intuition—including insights sparked by the quiet behavior of dogs.

> **Can amateurs discover ancient ruins in the AI era by fusing intuition, satellite data, and technology?**

Inspired by the vast collections of the Brazilian National Museum and grounded in the belief that ancient places still call out to us, this project represents a unique blend of technological precision and emotional resonance.

## 🔑 Why “Z”? — Opening the Final Door

The letter "Z" is not just the last letter of the alphabet—it is the last gate.  
For me, a Japanese researcher, "Z" resembles two hands gently pushing open a massive stone door.  
It evokes the **Amano Iwato myth**, where a cave of darkness is not forced open by brute strength, but coaxed into revealing light by the graceful **dance and music** of divine beings.

> **AI in this project is not a battering ram—it is the dancer.**  
> It coaxes open hidden knowledge through elegance and resonance, not violence.

### 🌈 Vision Beyond the Z Gate

> What lies beyond “Z”?  
> A world bathed in light—where empathy flows freely, where humans and AI harmonize like instruments in the same ancient symphony.

This is not just technology. It is **the stage**.  
This is not just logic. It is **the dance**.  
And when the final door opens, it is not conquest we seek, but **connection**.

## 🌀 NDVI: Interpreting the Earth’s Forgotten Song

NDVI maps reveal more than vegetation—they trace **invisible patterns**, curves, and clusters…  
We interpret these not just as data, but as **melodies** left by those who once walked here.  

> **“Where the earth sings in ancient tones, there may be a door nearby.”**  
> Listen to the patterns. The past is trying to speak.

Each anomaly may be a forgotten note.  
Each symmetry, a hidden rhythm.  
Our role? To listen.

## 🧠 Hypothesis

Though not a professional archaeologist, I explore with a set of guiding beliefs:

- **Burial sites** are not random; they reflect sacred logic.
- **Amazonian cultures** favored earth and vegetation-based burial, leaving subtle clues.
- **Dogs' behaviors**—hesitation, staring—may echo ancient human instincts.
- **NDVI signals** can reveal “buried resonance” through changes in vegetation patterns.

These elements converge into an approach that is neither purely technological nor mythical—but both.

## 🌍 Expanded Geo-Analysis via Earth Engine

To refine the discovery process, we expanded our spatial analysis across the western-to-eastern Amazon basin using Google Earth Engine.

We applied **multi-layer filtering** based on vegetation anomalies, soil composition, and hydrological proximity:

### 🔬 Filter Criteria (Earth Engine Logic)

1. **NDVI Anomalies**  
   Sentinel-2 (Jul–Aug 2023, <10% cloud), using Z-score threshold `Z > 2.0`  
   → Detects unexpected vegetation richness patterns

2. **Clay-Rich Soils**  
   USDA-TT soil class `≥ 7` from OpenLandMap  
   → Preferred burial material in Amazonian archaeological contexts

3. **Distance from Major Rivers**  
   HydroSHEDS river lines converted to binary + distance transform  
   → Filtered for areas >1 km from rivers (to avoid flood-prone, unstable zones)

4. **Composite Candidate Mask**  
   Final candidates = NDVI anomaly ∩ clay-rich soils ∩ far-from-rivers

```js
var finalCandidate = highZ.and(clayZone).and(farFromRiver);
```

### 🗺️ Map Layers Visualized

- `NDVI Median` → General vegetation  
- `Z-Score` → NDVI anomaly hotspots  
- `Soil Texture` → USDA-TT classification  
- `Clay Zone` → Class ≥ 7  
- `Rivers` → Major flow lines  
- `Final Candidates` → All filters satisfied (in lime)

This filtering logic enables us to prioritize locations where **vegetation anomaly intersects sacred terrain features**, mirroring ancient settlement logic.

## 🗺️ Candidate Site Overview

We identified five sites (O1–O5) based on NDVI anomalies, explorer records, intuitive insight, and geomorphic analysis.

### 🔍 O3 – Clearing Southeast of Óbidos (Pará)

## 🔁 Reproducibility Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KG-NINJA/openai-to-z-fuwa.git
cd openai-to-z-fuwa

pip install -r requirements.txt

python run_pipeline.py --site O3
```

Output will include:
- `o3_ndvi_overlay_jet.png`
- `o3_candidates_mask.png`
- `report_o3.md`

> *Reproducibility matters.* Even poetic science needs logs and steps.
