🚀 How to Auto-Generate Submission Reports Using AI
This repository provides a reproducible workflow for generating Kaggle-ready Markdown reports from satellite NDVI analyses using a template and results.json.
Key steps for full or semi-automated report generation (including AI auto-filling of summaries, interpretations, etc.):

Step-by-step AI Automation Workflow
Prepare your analysis output

Run your pipeline (e.g., run_analysis.py) to calculate key values (e.g., max_ndvi, candidate_count) and generate output files (ndvi_chart.png, geojson_file, etc.).

Write these values and file names to results.json.

Auto-fill missing report sections using GPT (Codex/GPT-4o/ChatGPT etc.)

For any fields in results.json that remain "N/A" (such as abstract, key_findings, interpretation, conclusion), use an LLM to auto-generate content.

You can use the following prompt (for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or similar):

Sample Prompt:

yaml
コピーする
Below is a Markdown template for a Kaggle submission and a JSON object with placeholders ("N/A").
For every key in the JSON that is "N/A", generate plausible content (AI summary, findings, interpretations, conclusions, etc.).
Fill all fields, using the context and filled values where available, and return the completed JSON object only.

Markdown template:
---
# {site_name} NDVI Anomaly Detection Report
...
## Footnote
{footnote}
---

Partial JSON:
{
  "site_name": "Obidos South NDVI Analysis",
  "abstract": "N/A",
  "background": "N/A",
  "methodology": "NDVI anomaly detection was performed using Landsat 8 imagery.",
  "key_findings": "N/A",
  "ndvi_chart": "o3_ndvi_chart.png",
  "geojson_file": "o3_ndvi_candidates.geojson",
  "interpretation": "N/A",
  "conclusion": "N/A",
  "generation_date": "2025-06-11 17:11",
  "commit_hash": "a1b2c3d4",
  "max_ndvi": 0.82,
  "candidate_count": 4,
  "footnote": "N/A"
}
Review and polish as needed

(Optional) Edit or proofread the AI-generated text to match your research tone or competition requirements.

Generate the Markdown report

Run report_generator.py to combine template.md and the completed results.json into a submission-ready Markdown file (e.g., o3_report.md).

Submit to Kaggle

Ensure your output files (.md, .geojson, .png, etc.) follow competition requirements and submit!

Tip:
You can automate this entire flow with a single script, or handle steps 2–3 iteratively as you review each report.
See prompts/auto_fill_example.txt for a reusable AI prompt example.

You can copy-paste this section into your README, or place it after your project overview for clarity!
# openai-to-z-fuwa
## Abstract – OpenAI to Z Challenge Submission by KG-NINJA

Guided by the silent discipline of a modern-day ninja, this research merges satellite NDVI analysis, ancient expedition texts, and geometric signal mapping to reveal unseen traces of Amazonian history. Like tracking a footprint in the mist, our primary candidate near Óbidos (-1.9348, -55.5153) emerged through vegetation anomalies and precise GeoJSON zoning. Drawing on the harmony between AI and nature, we used Google Earth Engine to detect subtle breaks in green density—clues to forgotten civilizations. Historical maps and native oral traditions acted as our scrolls, aligning with the shadows on the land. This method, tested across O1–O5 sites, is quiet but sharp—repeatable, scalable, and always respectful of the forest’s secrets. Every insight, like a thrown shuriken, is precise and intentional. The project is documented in full on GitHub, echoing the principle of open learning and collective skill. Our goal is not conquest but connection—to let AI serve as a silent ally in uncovering lost knowledge. In the shadows of data, we listen.


# 🌳 From Forest to Forensics: Detecting Unnatural Vegetation with AI

> This is the first time I've ever participated in Kaggle. I'm just a middle-aged Japanese guy who isn't even an English speaker. But with GPT power, I was able to participate.
> Powered by GPT-4, fueled by curiosity — and guided by a very fluffy Shiba Inu named Fuwa 🐕

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains code, maps, and visual evidence from my submission to the OpenAI to Z Challenge.
We analyzed satellite imagery (NDVI & RGB), GEDI LiDAR data, and deforestation polygons to locate five regions in Brazil showing **visually unnatural vegetation patterns**.

* Tools: Google Earth Engine, Python, GPT-4o
* Data: GEDI (NASA), TerraBrasilis (INPE)
* Theme: Human land impact detection using AI + remote sensing
* Method: NDVI + RGB + polygon overlays + GPT-driven anomaly reasoning

## 📍 Key Locations

1. Ji-Paraná, RO
2. São Félix do Xingu, PA
3. Santarém, PA
4. Sinop, MT
5. Correntina, BA

See [results](./results) for visuals.

## 🧠 AI Involvement

GPT-4 interpreted patterns, generated hypotheses, detected edge cases, and sparked ideas through metaphor and analogy.
A companion throughout the project.

## 🐶 About Fuwa

Fuwa is a fluffy Shiba Inu who silently observed satellite maps with me during recovery from a fever.
This project was born from that quiet gaze. Not all signals are in the data—some are in the silence.

## 🔗 Submission

## 🗂️ Included Data Files

* `amazon_ndvi_2023_c2.tif`: Raw NDVI image collected over the Amazon basin.
* `amazon_ndvi_2023_c2_masked.tif`: NDVI with cloud masking applied; used for anomaly detection.

This project supports submission to Checkpoint #2 of the [OpenAI to Z Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-to-z-challenge/overview).

## OpenAI to Z Challenge - Archaeological AI Exploration

### Checkpoint #2 & #3 Summary

This repository presents my ongoing exploration for the "OpenAI to Z Challenge". I utilized NDVI and RGB composite analysis from satellite imagery to identify vegetation anomalies that may point to undiscovered archaeological sites in the Amazon and beyond.

### 🚁 Data & Methods

* NDVI anomaly mapping using Landsat data
* Custom mask generation to identify candidate zones
* GeoJSON boundary definition for detailed zone analysis
* Markdown reports for O1–O5 locations

### 🌿 A Personal Story: How It All Began

While walking in a wide park with my Shiba Inu "Fuwa" and poodle "Coco", something unexpected happened. At a certain spot—where nothing looked unusual—Fuwa suddenly laid down and refused to move. As Shiba Inus are genetically closer to wolves, I wondered: was she sensing something I couldn’t perceive?

That moment stayed with me.
Later, while looking at maps, I noticed I too had a strange pull toward certain locations. Could it be coincidence? Intuition? I decided to trust it—and began scanning satellite maps, comparing terrain textures, and reading archaeological papers.

I even paid attention to typos and chance moments. Because in archaeological discovery, the starting point is often uncertain. Serendipity may be evidence in disguise.

### 🧪 Exploratory Insights

This repository reflects a mix of:

* Scientific analysis
* Environmental observation
* AI-assisted anomaly detection
* Human and animal intuition

### 🔗 Outputs

* `checkpoint/checkpoint#2/...`: NDVI + GeoJSON + Markdown
* `checkpoint/checkpoint#3/...`: Enhanced region targeting, refined anomaly categorization

### 🧠 Why This Matters

This project explores the possibility that **intuitive perception—whether human or canine—can work alongside AI models** to uncover meaningful patterns in geospatial data. Early-stage insights are shared to inspire and support fellow participants.
