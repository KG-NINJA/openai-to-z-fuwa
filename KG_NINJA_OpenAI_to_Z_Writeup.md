# 🧭 Shadows in the Green: Unearthing the Amazon with AI

In a forgotten corner of the Earth—where dense green veils conceal the whispers of the past—this project began not in a lab, but in silence. A Shiba Inu named Fuwa froze during a walk in a park. That pause sparked a question: what if intuition, animal instinct, and AI could converge to reveal human footprints long lost to the forest?

This is not just data science. It’s a modern archaeological odyssey, powered by satellite NDVI imagery, LiDAR, historical maps, and the quiet reasoning of GPT-4.

## 🔍 Project Summary

**Challenge**: Identify subtle, possibly human-altered vegetation patterns hidden in the Amazon.

**Tools**:  
- Google Earth Engine  
- GEDI LiDAR (NASA)  
- TerraBrasilis deforestation maps  
- GPT-4 for anomaly reasoning and hypothesis formation  

**Regions of Interest (ROIs)**:  
1. Ji-Paraná, RO  
2. São Félix do Xingu, PA  
3. Santarém, PA  
4. Sinop, MT  
5. Correntina, BA  

Each ROI was selected through NDVI anomaly filtering, followed by GPT-assisted validation using archaeological references and topographic intuition.

## 💡 AI Contribution

GPT-4 was not a tool—it was a co-pilot. It helped:
- Generate GeoJSON zones from abstract thoughts.
- Cross-reference historical exploration routes.
- Hypothesize why vegetation patterns “felt” wrong.
- Translate instinct into structured analysis.

## 🐾 Origin Story

It began with Fuwa laying down.  
Then came the maps.  
Then the questions.  
Now, it’s a framework—a pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Outputs

- `run_pipeline.py`: Orchestrates NDVI analysis and report generation  
- `checkpoint/#`: Categorized region folders  
- `generated_report.md`: Synthesized AI-supported insights  
- Visual evidence in `/results` folder

## 🧭 Final Insight

> AI can uncover ancient human stories—but only if we bring our own intuition into the loop.

This is not just an entry. It’s a proof of concept:
**That a middle-aged man in Osaka, guided by a Shiba Inu and AI, can scan the Earth for shadows of lost civilizations.**

And sometimes… he might find one.
