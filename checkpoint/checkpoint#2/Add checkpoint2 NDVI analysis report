# üåø AI-Assisted Discovery of Potential Burial Sites in Manaus

## üìç 1. Introduction

This report documents an AI-powered exploration to identify a potential archaeological site in downtown Manaus, Brazil. The investigation blends historical literature, remote sensing data (NDVI and DEM), and GPT-assisted interpretation.

### Goals:

* Use NDVI to detect vegetation anomalies
* Use DEM to reveal subtle elevation changes
* Cross-reference historical burial traditions
* Evaluate the hypothesis with GPT

## üìÖ 2. Historical Context

A century-old document described a discovery of red clay urns (Igapabas) in Manaus, believed to be indigenous burial artifacts. These urns were found near the city's old fortifications during land leveling operations.

> "Hundreds of large urns of red clay... used to bury the dead, seen there in long rows, at no great depth in the earth."

## üåç 3. Target Site: Hospital Rio Negro South

* **Coordinates:** `-60.023207, -3.124824`
* **Location type:** Unpaved open field within the urban core
* **Observation:** Satellite images show bare soil patches, unusual NDVI patterns, and surrounding urban development

## üå± 4. NDVI Analysis

**Tool:** Google Earth Engine

* **NDVI value at point:** `0.04` ‚Äî Extremely low
* **Nearby values:** `0.26 - 0.45`
* Interpretation: Likely disturbed or barren soil, possibly due to buried cultural material (e.g., urns, compacted layers)

## üåº 5. DEM Analysis

**Tool:** SRTM Digital Elevation Model (30m)

* **DEM status:** No data returned at key point; surrounding points show micro-elevation fluctuations
* Interpretation: Possible past ground modification or erosion masking the elevation signature

## üß† 6. GPT Hypothesis Evaluation

A prompt was crafted to evaluate the archaeological plausibility:

> Based on low NDVI, barren ground in an urban void, and historical burial references, could this location correspond to an undiscovered cultural layer?

**GPT's Response:** High likelihood. Indicators align with traditional burial grounds (low vegetation, red clay, river proximity, historical memory).

## üö™ 7. Conclusion

This investigation reveals a strong candidate site for further archaeological interest:

* Coordinates align with historic descriptions
* Remote sensing reveals natural and artificial disturbances
* AI models corroborate cultural likelihood

## ‚è≥ 8. Next Steps

* Refined DEM profiling with transect lines
* Literature-based site triangulation
* Collaboration with local archaeological teams
* Integration into Kaggle Checkpoint #2
